# Networking-Lib
A set of useful Java classes for handling server-client communication over sockets. \
Provided is both a secure (with SSL, now TLS) set of classes as well as their unsecure counterparts. \
A jar file with all of these classes (along with the example servers and clients, which might not be wanted) can be built, or the .java files can be copied into any project. \
There is also checksum support through the CRC class.
